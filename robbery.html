  <h1>ROBBERY</h1> 
  <br>
  <p>Robbery is the crime of taking or attempting to take anything of value by force, threat of force, or by use of fear. According to
    common law, robbery is defined as taking the property of another, with the intent to permanently deprive the person of that property,
    by means of force or fear; that is, it is a larceny or theft accomplished by an assault.<br>Precise definitions of the offence may 
    vary between jurisdictions. Robbery is differentiated from other forms of theft (such as burglary, shoplifting, pickpocketing, or car
    theft) by its inherently violent nature (a violent crime); whereas many lesser forms of theft are punished as misdemeanors, robbery is
    always a felony in jurisdictions that distinguish between the two. Under English law, most forms of theft are triable either way, 
    whereas robbery is triable only on indictment. The word "rob" came via French from Late Latin words (e.g., deraubare) of Germanic 
    origin, from Common Germanic raub "theft".<br><br>
    Among the types of robbery are armed robbery, which involves the use of a weapon, and aggravated robbery, when someone brings with
    them a deadly weapon or something that appears to be a deadly weapon. Highway robbery or mugging takes place outside or in a public 
    place such as a sidewalk, street, or parking lot. Carjacking is the act of stealing a car from a victim by force. Extortion is the 
    threat to do something illegal, or the offer to not do something illegal, in the event that goods are not given, primarily using words
    instead of actions.
    Criminal slang for robbery includes "blagging" (armed robbery, usually of a bank) or "stick-up" (derived from the verbal command to 
    robbery targets to raise their hands in the air), and "steaming" (organized robbery on underground train systems).</p>
