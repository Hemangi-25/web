                   Crime is the deliberate performance of an act explicitly stated, prohibited, unlawful, and punished by
                   criminal law, which is considered harmful and damaging to society. The definitions of specific crimes
                   contained in a code must be analyzed in the context of many concepts, out of them some may not be
                   defined in the code itself. The majority of crime is classified on the seriousness of the act or conduct.  
                   Every crime must satisfy all requirements for that particular crime to be proven guilty. If the action of a
                   person satisfies every requirement of an offense, they are said to have committed a crime. The offense and its
                   elements are outlined under the same criminal statute.
